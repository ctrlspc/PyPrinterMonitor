This is a library-in-progress, developed by Jason Marshall from the School of Psychology at the University of Kent, UK

It is being written so that we can remotely monitor our networked printers using SNMP, and send warning to our ticket management system.
To give us flexibility we are not going to send messages directly to our TMS (we are currently using RT) but to a RabbitMQ message queue,
we will then have a daemon that will pull messages from this queue and stick them in the TMS.

This library is far from complete at the moment, and there will be significant changes in the future, not least packaging it so that
dependencies are instlled for you.

NEWS:

11-Jan-2012 v.0.0.1 pushed - This is the first working increment of the library, but it is daar from shippable.
